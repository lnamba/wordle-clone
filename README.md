# Wordle-ish

As a big fan of the game Wordle, I decided to write my own version of the famous word puzzle. It's built in React, with plans for Typescript on the way. Try it out [here](https://wordle-ish-f6149.firebaseapp.com). Play the original Wordle [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Run with `npm start`.
